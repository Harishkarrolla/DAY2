In SQL, the INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands are used to manage the data within a database. The INSERT command is used to add new records into a table. It allows users to input specific values for different columns, thereby creating a new row in the table. The UPDATE command is used to modify or change the existing records in a table. It updates one or more columns based on the condition provided; without a condition, it can update all rows. The DELETE command is used to remove records from a table. Like UPDATE, it uses a WHERE clause to specify which rows should be deleted. If the WHERE clause is not used, it will delete all records from the table. These commands are essential for maintaining and managing the data stored in any relational database.
